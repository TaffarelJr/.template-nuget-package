# Reporting Security Issues

We take security vulnerabilities very seriously.
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings
and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please use [Security Advisories][advisories]
to report any security issues.
The repo owners will keep you informed
of progress toward a fix, will make any necessary announcements,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.
