## Asking Quality Questions

Questions, ideas, and suggestions are best handled
in the [Discussions][discussions].

Help us help you!
Spend time framing questions and add links and resources.
Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.
Here are some tips:

- First, [talk to a duck][rubberduck]!
- Donâ€™t fall for the [XY problem][xy]
- Search to find out if a similar question has been asked
  - The [Documentation][docs] and [Wiki][wiki] are great places to start
  - A [Discussion][discussions] or [Issue][issues]
    may have already been created that addresses your topic
  - An old-fashioned internet search can also be helpful
- Try to define what you need help with:
  - Is there something in particular you want to do?
  - What problem are you encountering,
    and what steps have you taken to try and fix it?
  - Is there a concept you donâ€™t understand?
- Provide sample code, such as a [CodeSandbox][sandbox] or video, if possible
- Screenshots can help, but if thereâ€™s important text
  such as code or error messages in them,
  please also provide them as text to make them more searchable
- The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you!
