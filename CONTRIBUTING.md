### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others
needing to chase you up for more information.
Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully,
collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report.
Please complete the following steps in advance
to help us fix any potential bugs as fast as possible:

- Make sure you're using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side
  e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions
  (Make sure you've searched the [Documentation][docs] and [Wiki][wiki].
  If you're looking for support,
  you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced
  (and potentially already solved) the same issue,
  [check if there is already a bug report for your issue][issues].
- Also make sure to search the internet (including [Stack Overflow][so])
  to see if users outside the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform, and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment,
    package manager, etc. - depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the project's output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue?
  And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security-related issues, vulnerabilities,
> or bugs that include sensitive information
> to the issue tracker or elsewhere in public.
> Instead, see [`SECURITY.md`][security]
> for more information on how to handle sensitive bugs.

We use [Issues][issues] to track bugs, errors, and performance issues.
If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open a new [Bug Report][newBug] or [Performance Issue][newIssue].
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
  (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it's a bug or not,
  we ask you not to talk about it being a "bug" yet
  and not to label the issue.)
- **Describe the current behavior**
  and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
  At this point you can also tell which alternatives did not work for you.
- Please **provide as much context as possible**
  and **describe the reproduction steps** that someone else can follow
  to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code.
  For good bug reports you should isolate the problem
  and create a reduced test case.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs**
  which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the defect.
  It can be helpful to record the problem,
  using tools like [LICEcap][licecap] (macOS/Windows)
  or [Silentcast][silentcast] (Linux).

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps.
- If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue,
  the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`.
  Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed
  until they're able to be reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`,
  as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`),
  and the issue will be left to be
  [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion,
including **completely new features** and **changes to existing functionality**.
Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community
to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you're using the latest version.
- Search the [Documentation][docs] and [Wiki][wiki] carefully
  and find out if the functionality is already covered,
  maybe by an individual configuration.
- Search the [Discussions][discussions] and [Issues][issues]
  to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
  If it has, add a comment to the existing thread instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
  It's up to you to make a strong case
  to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.
  Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful
  to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.
  If you're just targeting a minority of users,
  consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [Issues][issues],
_after receiving approval in the [Discussions][discussions]_.

- Open a new [Feature Request][newFeature].
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement**
  in as much detail as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior**
  and **explain which behavior you would like to see instead** and why.
  At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.
  You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better
  and which could serve as inspiration.

## Contributing Changes

Changes will be merged if they improve the project in some way.
All contributions are made via
a [pull request (PR) from a _fork_ of the repo][ghFork]
rather than through direct commits or PRs from branches _in_ the repo.
The pull requests are merged after review and approval from a code owner.

### Quick Code Review Rules

- Don't mix unrelated changes in one pull request.
  For example, a code style change should never be mixed with a bug fix.
  Keep PRs short and sweet!
- All changes should follow the existing code style;
  we favor consistency over any specific convention.
  This is enforced by the analyzers and style rules embedded in the project.
  They should be picked up by your IDE—address any warnings before submitting.
- Make sure lines of code are relatively short,
  following the [Vertical Rulers](#vertical-rulers) section.
- Make sure Git commit messages follow the rules
  outlined in the [Commit Messages](#commit-messages) section.
- Use `Draft` pull requests for changes you're still working on,
  but want early CI loop feedback for.
  When you think your changes are ready for review,
  [change the status][ghStatus] of your pull request.
- Rebasing is encouraged, to keep a clean history of changes.

### Pull Request Ownership

The code owners of the project have the final say
when it comes to style, merge, or other conflicts.
While a PR may satisfy all the technical requirements,
a code owner may still make or request additional changes
if they feel it necessary to maintain project consistency and/or integrity.
Code owners reserve the right to alter the code and/or commits
in a PR themselves before approving and merging it.

### Merging Pull Requests

Pull requests will be merged by a code owner
when the following conditions have been met:

- The PR has been approved by at least one code owner
  and any other objections are addressed.
  - You can request another review from the original reviewer.
- The PR successfully builds and passes all tests
  in the Continuous Integration (CI) system.

### Blocking Pull Request Merging

If for whatever reason you would like to move your pull request
back to an in-progress status to avoid merging it in the current form,
you can turn the PR into a draft PR by
selecting the option under the reviewers section.

## Your First Code Contribution

Issues marked with a `good first issue` or `help wanted` label
can be a great place to start if you're looking to start contributing.

## Styleguides

Required code styling is enforced
by the analyzers and style rules embedded in the project.
They should be picked up by your IDE.
Make sure to address any errors, warnings, or messages before submitting a PR.

Beyond that, try to make the code as readable as possible.
Functions should be small. Classes and members should be documented.
Favor explicit over implicit code.

Code comments can be very helpful to explain _why_
a chunk of code is doing what it's doing;
but if you're tempted to add code comments to explain _what_ it's doing,
that's a good sign that the code should be refactored.
Code should be self-documenting in that regard.

### Vertical Rulers

In order to facilitate side-by-side code comparisons,
this project encourages lines of code to be kept relatively short:

- **Up to 80 characters** is the ideal maximum line width.
  Wrap lines of code by this point as often as possible.
- **Up to 100 characters** is fine, if it's more asthetically pleasing
  than wrapping would be.
- **Up to 120 characters** _can be_ acceptable
- if the end of the line doesn't change often or is common boilerplate
  (such as cancellation tokens or other standard, optional function parameters).
- **Over 120 characters** is not acceptable, and must be wrapped
  unless there's no other choice: e.g., a long URL link in a Markdown file.

To facilitate this, it's recommended to display vertical rulers
in your IDE of choice:

- **Visual Studio**: Install the [Editor Guidelines][guidelines] extension.
  Vertical rulers are defined in the `.editorconfig` file,
  and will appear automatically.

- **Visual Studio Code**: Unfortunately, manual configuration is required.
  Go to `Settings` -> `Rulers` and add something like the following:
  ```json
  "editor.rulers": [
    // Colors are in RGBA format
    { "column": 80, "color": "#00ff0050" },
    { "column": 100, "color": "#ffff0075" },
    { "column": 120, "color": "#8b0000ff" }
  ],
  ```

### Commit Messages

This repo uses [Conventional Commits][cc]
to standardize the format of commit messages.
This enables the automation of things like versioning
and the generation of changelogs & release notes.

If you're new to or unfamiliar with [Conventional Commits][cc],
this [Cheat sheet by Bengt Brodersen][ccCheat] can help with the basics.

To facilitate this, a default Git message template is included in the project.
You can activate it by running the following command from the repository root:

```bash
git config commit.template .gitmessage
```

Afterward, whenever you run `git commit` (without the `-m` switch)
the template should be displayed in your configured text editor.
(Other Git tooling should pick it up as well.)
Simply replace the template with your formatted commit message, and save it.
