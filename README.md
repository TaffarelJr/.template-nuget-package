# .github Repository

Contains the default community health files for all my other repositories.

For more information on how this functionality works,
see the official [GitHub documentation][health]
or this post on [freeCodeCamp][fcc].

Community health files available to be standardized:

- [x] **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - defines standards for how to engage in a community
- [x] **CONTRIBUTING.md** - communicates how people should contribute to your project
- [ ] **Discussion category forms** - customize the templates that are available
      for community members to use when they open new discussions in your repository
- [x] **FUNDING.yml** - displays a sponsor button in your repository
      to increase the visibility of funding options for your open source project
- [ ] **GOVERNANCE.md** - lets people know about how your project is governed.
      For example, it might discuss project roles and how decisions are made.
- [x] **Issue and pull request templates and config.yml** - customize and standardize
      the information you'd like contributors to include
      when they open issues and pull requests in your repository
- [x] **SECURITY.md** - gives instructions on how to report a security vulnerability
      in your project and description that hyperlinks the file
- [x] **SUPPORT.md** - lets people know about ways to get help with your project
